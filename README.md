# auto-kaomoji

A minimal kaomoji input panel for windows built with AutoHotKey.

## Usage

Install AutoHotKey and run the script with in 64 bit Unicode. Or run the executable directly.

Kaomojis are saved in `Kaomoji.txt` in the same directory as the script/executable, one kaomoji per line. No **TAB** is allowed in kaomojis. After updating the list, relaunch the script to load.

Put a link to the script/executable into `shell:Startup` folder to start it with Windows.
